# Project Overview: Descriptive Analysis of Airbnb Listings in Amsterdam (December 6th, 2018)

This project involves analyzing Airbnb listings in Amsterdam to identify key pricing trends and the factors influencing these trends, such as amenities, review scores, and location. The goal is to uncover patterns that could inform optimized pricing strategies for Airbnb hosts in Amsterdam.

## The Project Includes:

### Data Analysis:
The analysis uses Airbnb data for listings in Amsterdam from December 6th, 2018, to 2019. This dataset includes key features such as room type, number of beds, review scores, and other listing attributes. The analysis reveals pricing trends based on these factors.

## Key Questions Addressed:
The analysis explores the following key questions, providing valuable insights for stakeholders:

1. **How do pricing trends vary across different room types?**  
   Investigating how room types (e.g., entire home, private room, shared room) impact pricing.

2. **How do amenities influence pricing?**  
   Analyzing the correlation between specific amenities (e.g., Wi-Fi, air conditioning, kitchen) and listing prices.

3. **What is the relationship between review scores and prices?**  
   Understanding whether higher review scores correlate with higher prices and how customer satisfaction influences pricing.

4. **How does location affect pricing?**  
   Exploring how proximity to key areas (e.g., city center, tourist destinations) influences listing prices.

5. **Are there seasonal price fluctuations?**  
   Investigating whether prices vary by season, focusing on peak and off-peak periods.

## Tools and Technologies:
The analysis is conducted using a combination of the following tools and technologies:

- **Python (Jupyter Notebooks)**: For data analysis, manipulation, and visualization using libraries like pandas, NumPy, and matplotlib.
- **Excel**: Used for preliminary data exploration and basic visualizations.
- **Tableau**: To create interactive dashboards and provide dynamic insights.
- **Cluster Analysis**: Implemented using Python and Excel to group listings based on pricing and attribute patterns.

## Data Visualization:
The project utilizes **scatter plots** to identify relationships between variables. Visualizations include:

1. **Scatter Plots**:  
   Displaying the relationship between price and factors such as review scores, number of beds, and amenities.  
   Highlighting clusters of listings with similar attributes using color-coded groups.

2. **Cluster Analysis**:  
   Using K-Means clustering to segment listings into distinct price groups based on their attributes. These clusters are visualized with scatter plots and analyzed to uncover pricing trends.

3. **Excel**:  
   Scatter plots and basic visualizations for initial exploration and simple clustering to visualize patterns across key variables.

4. **Tableau**:  
   Interactive dashboards to explore trends in real-time, offering insights on location-based price variations, amenitiesâ€™ impact, and more.

## Final Report:
The final report will summarize:
- **Methodology**: A detailed description of the data analysis process, including data cleaning, feature engineering, and clustering.
- **Findings**: Key insights derived from scatter plots and cluster analysis, focusing on factors that influence Airbnb prices.
- **Recommendations**: Practical suggestions for Airbnb hosts to optimize their pricing strategies based on these findings.
- **Data Citations**: Proper attribution to the sources used in the analysis.
