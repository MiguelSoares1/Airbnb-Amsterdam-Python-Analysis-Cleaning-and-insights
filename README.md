# Project Overview: Airbnb Amsterdam - Descriptive Analysis of Listings (December 6th, 2018)

This project involves analyzing Airbnb listings in Amsterdam to identify key pricing trends and the factors influencing these trends, such as amenities, review scores, and location. The goal is to uncover patterns that could inform optimized pricing strategies for Airbnb hosts in Amsterdam.

## The Project Includes:

### Data Analysis:
The analysis leverages Airbnb data for listings in Amsterdam from December 6th, 2018, to 2019. This dataset includes key features such as room type, number of beds, review scores, and other listing attributes. The analysis aims to reveal pricing trends based on these factors.

## Key Questions Addressed:
The analysis explores several key questions, providing valuable insights for stakeholders:

1. **What are the pricing trends across different room types?**  
   Investigating how different room types (e.g., entire home, private room, shared room) impact pricing.

2. **How do amenities influence pricing?**  
   Analyzing whether specific amenities (e.g., Wi-Fi, air conditioning, kitchen) lead to higher listing prices.

3. **What is the relationship between review scores and prices?**  
   Understanding if higher review scores are associated with higher pricing and whether customer satisfaction can be linked to price changes.

4. **How does location affect pricing?**  
   Exploring how proximity to key areas (e.g., city center, tourist destinations) influences the price of listings.

5. **Are there seasonal pricing fluctuations?**  
   Determining whether prices vary by season, with a focus on identifying peak and off-peak periods.

## Tools and Technologies:
The analysis is conducted using a combination of the following tools and technologies:

- **Python (Jupyter Notebooks)**: For data analysis, manipulation, and visualization using libraries such as pandas, NumPy, and matplotlib.
- **Excel**: Used for preliminary data exploration and basic visualizations.
- **Tableau**: To create interactive dashboards and provide dynamic insights into the data.
- **Cluster Analysis**: Implemented using Python and Excel to group listings based on similar pricing and attribute patterns.

## Data Visualization:
The project primarily utilizes **scatter plots** to identify patterns and relationships between variables. The visualizations include:

1. **Scatter Plots**:  
   Displaying relationships between price and various factors like review scores, number of beds, and amenities.  
   Highlighting clusters of listings that share similar characteristics using color-coded groups.

2. **Cluster Analysis**:  
   Using clustering algorithms (e.g., K-Means) to segment listings into distinct price groups based on their attributes. These clusters are visualized through scatter plots and further analyzed to understand pricing trends.

3. **Excel**:  
   Scatter plots and basic visualizations for initial exploratory analysis.  
   Simple clustering for visualizing patterns across key variables.

4. **Tableau**:  
   Interactive dashboards to explore trends in real-time, providing stakeholders with visual insights on location-based price variations, amenitiesâ€™ impact, and more.

## Final Report:
The final report will summarize:
- **Methodology**: Step-by-step description of the data analysis process, including data cleaning, feature engineering, and clustering.
- **Findings**: Key insights derived from scatter plots and cluster analysis, focusing on the factors influencing Airbnb prices.
- **Recommendations**: Practical suggestions for Airbnb hosts to optimize their pricing strategies based on the findings.
- **Data Citations**: Proper attribution of the data sources used in the analysis.
